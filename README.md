# TeslaExample
worked example of Tesla data

This is a worked example of the Tesla stock data.   Notice that in the 'predict average' category I took out the percent change.   Easy to predict a category when you know what the percent change.

I also set this example to use a random selection of the stock data for the training and test sets. We more-or-less decided in class this makes the most sense.
